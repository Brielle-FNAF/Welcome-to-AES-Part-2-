        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Ardmore elementary school

           Ardmore Elementary school is where K-5 grade is being teached. Ardmore was found by a Principal called "Principal Herring".

            Mrs. Herring is the first one to find this school. <br><br>Mrs. Melreta Herring was appointed Principal of Ardmore Elementary School July 1, 2019 serving approximately 407 students in grades Pre-K through fifth grade. Prior to her appointment, she served nineteen years as a classroom teacher and two years as an Assistant Principal at Ardmore Elementary School. Mrs. Herring is a graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C and Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. She also has a Masters degree in Education Administration from Grand Canyon University. 


            In addition, Mrs. Herring has over thirty years of educational experience. Her love for children and their well-being has motivated her to this level. Her motto is, “If a child cannot learn the way we teach, we should teach the way they learn.” by Ignacio Estrada.  She is a member of Naomi Grand Chapter Order of Eastern Star and serves her community as a Sunday School Teacher at United Baptist Church.  She is married and a mother of two sons and a daughter. 

            As educators, we believe all students have the right to a quality educational program that will develop them into becoming productive citizens in our community. We believe that students should have a well-organized and well-structured academic program that will build strong academic preparation, social and interpersonal skills, and esthetic appreciation for the performing arts. We believe the education of all students is not confined to the school alone.
The home, the community, and other institutions must play important roles to ensure all students are academically and socially prepared to become lifelong learners. To provide the best education possible for every student, there must be full participation and collaboration between the school, community, parents, teachers, students and administrators.</p>

She told me that she wanted to go to ardmore forever. And it just makes me happy to see her big smile on her face. The teachers try their best and that's all that matters. Your child would love it their. I'm giving you some advise to enroll your child for Ardmore Elementary School so he/she could learn something new! Thanks Ardmore School and teachers!</p> </div> </div>

            <p>Best school ever. Learn new things! I have 2 sons which went to ardmore. Right now their in 2nd grade. They're enjoying the teachers and friends! Ardmore has been a lifesaver. It was hard to look for a school. But when I found Ardmore I thought my kids would make a great fix for the kids and children to learn something new from school! Enroll your child to this school so you kid(s) can learn more new and never learned things.</p> </div> </div>
